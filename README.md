### Hi there ðŸ‘‹

I am an 18 year old university student with a drive to create new and interesting things, from the development of the back-end of common computer games to empowering autonomous robots! 

ðŸ”­ Iâ€™m an alumni of a @FIRSTRobotics affiliate team, in which I focused on aspects of autonomous and safety oriented robots!\nâœ¨ I am currently majoring in Cybersecurity, although I often times work on projects involving other specialties!

Hope to see ya around!
