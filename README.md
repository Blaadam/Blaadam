### Hi!

I am Blaadam, a proficient Software Engineer with a strong foundation in Lua, JavaScript and C#. My focus is on enhancing my expertise in these areas and broadening my technical know-how to solve complex challenges efficiently.

As an aspiring Software Engineer, I'm currently delving into A-Levels in Computer Science, and Cambridge Technical Level 3 Information Technology. This rigorous academic endeavour is powering my desire to understand complex computational principles and fueling my commitment towards becoming a proficient problem solver in the tech industry.

I hope to talk to you soon!
